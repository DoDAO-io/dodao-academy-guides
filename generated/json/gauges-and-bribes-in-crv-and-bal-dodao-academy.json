      "content": "### Gauges\n\nAll liquidity mining BAL minted is distributed through the gauge system. Gauges allow LPs (liquidity providers) to stake their BPT (Balancer Pool Token) and periodically claim BAL from liquidity mining.\n\nThe amount received by each LP depends on:\n1) How much the pool they are providing liquidity to receives\n2) What share of the pool’s liquidity they have\n3) The boost applied to their LP share based on how much veBAL they hold\nEach pool receives a share of the total BAL minted every week. That share is defined by how much veBAL voted for that pool.\n\n### Gauge Types\nThere are different gauge types that are used in the ve system, each type gets a fixed percentage of the BAL supply minted weekly. Within each gauge type there can be many gauges that share the amount of BAL sent to that gauge type. The following gauge types and weights are proposed:\n\n1) Liquidity Mining committee: 10% (14,500 BAL)\n2) veBAL: 10% (14,500 BAL)\n3) Ethereum mainnet pools: 56% (81,200 BAL)\n4) Polygon pools: 17% (24,650 BAL)\n5) Arbitrum pools: 7% (10,150 BAL)\n\nNew gauge types can be added and the weights/percentages of all gauge types can be changed by governance. These changes are however not expected to happen frequently.\n\n\n",
