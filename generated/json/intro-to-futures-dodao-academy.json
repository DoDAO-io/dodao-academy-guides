      "content": "## **Define futures**\nFutures are financial derivative contracts that bind parties to buy or sell an asset at a specified future date and price. Regardless of the market price at the date of expiration, the buyer or seller must buy or sell the underlying asset at the agreed-upon price.\n\nPhysical commodities and financial instruments are examples of underlying assets. Futures contracts are standardized to make trading on a futures market easier and specify the quantity of the underlying asset. Futures can be utilized for trade speculation or hedging.\n\nFutures or Futures contracts have an expiration date and their price is known beforehand. These contracts are identified by their expiration month. For example, November futures will expire in the month of November.\n\n## **Types of futures**\nThe term futures is used to signify a large class of assets that they represent. These include :\n1. **Commodity Futures** which consist of crude oil, wheat, natural gas etc.\n2. **Stock index futures** with underlying assets such as the S&P 500 Index\n3. **Currency futures** which represent British Pound and Euro\n4. **Precious Metals** such as gold or silver\n5. **U.S. treasury futures** with underlying bond and financial securities\n\n## **Important Terms**\n1. **Future Contract**: Futures Contracts are a type of financial instrument through which a buyer can wager on the future price of a commodity or other security.\n2. **Futures price**: Futures price is the price of a futures contract at which the buyer and seller have agreed upon the sale and delivery of an asset at a later time. It is equal to the price of the underlying asset.\n3. **Spot Price**: The current price or the market price of an asset is known as the spot price.\n4. **Long Position**: Traders are said to obtain a long position when they buy a stock or own particular ones.\n5. **Short Position**: Short selling is the sale of securities that the seller does not own, but has borrowed, in the market and buys them back later, which can result in significant losses if the market rises.\n6. **Bid**: The price at which the buyer is ready to buy an asset.\n7. **Ask**: The price at which the seller is ready to sell an asset.\n8. **Points (Future value)**: A point in futures trading represents the smallest whole number price increment in the value of a futures contract.\n9. **Tick**: A tick is a smaller fraction of a point in a futures price change.",

Each futures contract consists of various parameters known as contract parameters. These are:\n1. The unit of measurement.\n2. How the trade will be settled – through physical delivery or cash settlement\n3. The number of goods to be delivered or covered under the contract. \n4. The currency unit in which the contract is denominated\n5. The currency in which the futures contract is quoted.\n6. Grade and quality standards, when appropriate.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-academy-guides/main/images/guides/futures/Futures.png)\n\n\nFutures contracts are traded on an exchange. In the above capture we can se ETH-1230 December futures being traded on the platform. The blue line represents (Index Price) the average of ETH prices across major exchanges and the candlesticks below represents the Mark price. In the right panel parameters such as minimum order size, expiration date and volume traded in last 24 hours have also been mentioned.\n\n## Explain who creates these contracts\nFutures contracts are created and regulated by exchanges. These exchanges are responsible for the standardization of various parameters in these contracts. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversees futures markets (CFTC). In order to protect the integrity of futures market pricing, including prohibiting fraudulent activity and abusive trading methods, the CFTC is a government organization that was established by Congress in 1974.\n",

      "content": "Futures can be used to hedge against price fluctuations in the underlying asset. In this instance, preventing losses from potentially negative price movements is the goal rather than engaging in speculation. Many businesses engage in hedging or, in certain situations, produce the underlying asset.\n\nFutures, for instance, can be used by maize producers to set a fixed price for selling their harvest. Suppose the farmer agrees to come up with a futures contract with a maize mill at $1000 / ton for three months to deliver maize. \n\nNow suppose three months pass and the delivery time arrives and the spot price of maize is $900 / ton i.e. the prices fell. In this scenario, the farmer benefited because he had already hedged his position through the futures contract at $1000 / ton of maize. In this case, the mill owner is at a loss because he agreed to the fixed price of $1000/ton when the current market price is $900/ton.\n\nWhereas if the sport price of maise is $1200 / ton i.e. the prices of maise rose. In this case, as the farmer has hedged his position so he will get the fixed price of the futures contract which is $1000 / ton but he would have sold maize to the market he would get $1200/ton. Hence the farmer is at a loss and the mill owner is at profit.\n\nHence if the price of futures rises the seller is at a loss and the buyer is benefitted. On contrary, if the prices fall the seller is benefitted and the buyer is at a loss. \n",

The trader would profit if a futures contract and the commodity's price rose to trade above the contract's starting price at expiration. The futures contract—the long position—would be sold at the current price before expiration, so completing the long position.\n\nNo actual exchange of commodity takes place, instead, the difference in the prices would be resolved in cash in the investor's margin account. The trader might suffer a loss or gain on the basis of the sport price versus the fixed price of the futures contract.\n\nA speculator may also take a short speculative position if they anticipate a drop in the value of the underlying asset. If the price does decline, the trader will adopt a contrary position to close the contract. The contract’s expiration will only happen when the difference between the prices is resolved till the expiration date. If the price of the underlying asset was less than the contract price, the investor would profit, if it was higher, the investor would lose money.\n\nIt's crucial to keep in mind that leverage trading enables traders to take far larger positions than those permitted by the size of their brokerage account. Margin investing can result in profits but on the other hand, it can also increase losses.\n\nConsider a trader who has a $60,000 position in crude oil and has a $6,000 margin account balance. Losses that are far more than the $6,000 initial margin amount for the account would happen if the price of oil swings against the deal. In such a scenario, the broker would issue a margin call and ask the trader to deposit more money in their account to cover up for the losses.\n",

A corporation can use a long hedge to fix the price at which it will buy a commodity in the future when it is required. They are required to carry out these tasks but are not given a choice.\n\nLet's say a jewellery maker thinks the short-term trend for gold prices will be rising. The company can agree on a long futures contract with its gold supply to buy gold from the provider in three months for $1,300. The company that holds a long position in gold futures is required to buy the gold from the supplier in three months, regardless of whether the price is above or below $1,300. If the prices of gold rise in the upcoming time and the maker predicted right then the jewellery maker will profit whereas if the prices fall the jewellery maker will be at a loss. When the contract ends, the provider is then required to deliver the tangible good.\n\nSpeculators buy futures when they anticipate price increases. They are just concerned with profiting from price fluctuations, therefore they don't necessarily need the actual commodity. A trader with a long futures contract may sell the contract in the market before it expires.\n\nHence we can conclude in a long position -\n* Prices rise: The position holder is at a profit\n* Prices fall: The position holder is at a loss",

When a trader anticipates that the price of a security will drop in the near future, she may elect to short that security.\n\nOnly when the closing price is lower than the entry price is the short trade profitable. When the price rises above the price at which one has shorted, a loss would result. In a short trade, the stop loss is always set higher than the price at which the trade was initiated. In the futures market, the short position may be kept open overnight.\n\n\nConsider the previous example of a jewellery maker. This time the gold provider predicts that the prices of the gold metal will fall in the upcoming time period. So this provider can agree upon a short contract for three months at $1300. This provider has to sell the gold as per contract after three months, regardless of the spot price, at $1300. If the price of gold goes below and the provider predicted correctly then he will profit otherwise if the prices rise then the provider will be in a loss position. When the contract ends, the provider is then required to deliver the tangible good. \n\nHence we can conclude in a short position -\n* Prices rise: The position holder is at a loss\n* Prices fall: The position holder is at a profit",
