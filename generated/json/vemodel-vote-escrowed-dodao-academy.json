      "content": "Vote Escrow Model\nVote Escrow is a system that allows users to lock up their tokens for a set period of time. The main goal of this system is to align users' incentives and focus on long-term Protocol performance.\n\nIn essence, Vote Escrow Tokens, or veTokens, give token holders the ability to choose a lock-up period for their tokens. The belief is that users who timelock tokens for the longest period of time believe in the Protocol the most and should therefore have the greatest influence on the direction of the Protocol.\n\nThe longer you elect to lock up your tokens, the more weight your tokens may get in:\n1. Governance voting\n2. Earning staking rewards\n3. Voting on boosts to certain Pools\n\nThis system is quickly becoming popular as a replacement for the current liquidity mining system in DeFi. Time-locked tokenomics could be the answer to the current liquidity mining system and a positive step for DeFi.\n\n        ",

      "content": "The Curve team decided to introduce the veCRV model to provide an incentive for users to hold CRV tokens long-term. With this model, when you provide liquidity to a Pool on Curve, you earn a share of all the fees on that Pool and CRV tokens as a bonus incentive.\n\nThis means that users are more likely to hold onto their CRV tokens, rather than selling them off, which in turn drives up the token price. Many believe that this is the reason why Curve’s token price continues to grow.\n\nveCRV explained in simple terms:\n1. veCRV stands for Vote Escrowed CRV.\n2. The only way to obtain veCRV is by locking CRV tokens.\n3. Users can lock CRV tokens for one to four years to receive a certain amount of veCRV in return.\n4. The longer CRV is locked, the greater voting power the holder has\n\nThere are at least three relevant reasons users lock CRV for veCRV: earning a passive income on transactions conducted through Curve Pools, the ability to boost rewards in different CRV Pools, and voting rights.\n\nVote weights and shares of rewards are proportional to Curve’s timelock. Users that lock veCRV for more time will accrue greater rewards. For a project that launched a token on Curve, liquidity voting rights present a massive opportunity. By locking your CRV for veCRV, you're not only earning rewards passively, but you're also gaining voting power that could be used to make decisions about the future of the project.\n\nA Protocol can deposit stablecoins into a Curve Pool to make it liquid or acquire enough veCRV to vote for that Pool to get more CRV rewards. In doing so, they are competing with other Protocols that issue stablecoins to get voting power within Curve's ecosystem - giving rise to the \"Curve Wars.\"",
