      "content": "To get started with financial transactions, one needs to have a bank account. Similarly, to get started with cryptocurrency, one needs to have a crypto wallet.\n\n\n## Crypto Wallets\n\nA crypto wallet is made up of two parts - the public key and the private key. The public key is like your account number at a bank, and is used by other crypto users to send funds into your account. The private key is like your netbanking PIN, and is necessary to send funds out of your account. If someone gets hold of your private keys, they can move funds from your address to anywhere else. So, it's really important to store your private keys safely!\n\nFor non-technical users, this may sound daunting and even for tech-savvy users, the idea of losing a private key is scary. We're all used to using an email/username password for our accounts and it's okay to forget those occasionally. If we lose every detail of our bank account, we can usually go to a physical bank branch and have someone help us reset our access. But this type of setup isn't possible with blockchain/cryptocurrency, and that's what keeps a lot of users away.\n\nThere are many websites that allow you to easily buy cryptocurrency, and many of these use the traditional email/password approach. But since blockchain technology doesn't allow for this, how are these sites able to provide such an easy way to access and buy crypto? Are there any risks from using these websites? We will answer all of these questions in this guide/article.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the gateway to accessing the financial world is a bank account. In the same way, the gateway to accessing the crypto world is a wallet. Crypto wallets can be divided into two categories: \n\n1. Custodial Wallets - Custodial wallets are a type of cryptocurrency wallet where the private keys are held by a third party. This third party can be an exchange, a custodian, or another type of organization. Custodial wallets are often seen as an easy way for new users to get started with cryptocurrency, but there are several risks that come with using this type of wallet. We will be looking at these risks in detail in the next section\n2. Non-Custodial Wallets - With this type of wallet, you are in control of the tokens or cryptocurrency you purchase. This approach appears to be more promising, but also has many complexities that come with it.\n\nIn this article, we will outline the advantages and disadvantages of custodial and non-custodial wallets without attempting to compare them with one another.",

      "content": "## Custodial Wallets\nIf you're just getting started with cryptocurrency, you might be already using a custodian wallet. With this type of wallet, your private keys are held by a centralized organization - usually an exchange. These exchanges allow you to convert fiat currency to cryptocurrency (and vice versa).\n\nMany people worry that if they don't hold onto their private keys, somebody else might cheat them. And they're right to be worried - we've seen countless examples of billions of dollars being lost by customers because of the poor business decisions of centralized organizations/exchanges.\n\nNot all centralized crypto organizations are created equal - much like banks. Most banks are regulated and individuals' money is insured by the government in most cases. However, many centralized crypto organizations are not regulated and have been known to make bad business decisions that result in customers losing their funds. Some crypto exchanges are regulated and audited by the government, though. Coinbase is one such exchange that is both regulated and audited by the government.\n\nSince many cryptocurrency exchanges are not regulated, meaning they don't have to hold customers' funds in a 1:1 ratio. This means they can use customer crypto to buy other assets and engage in high-risk bets. If these bets pay off, the customer is happy and the exchange makes a lot of money. But when these highly leveraged bets go against the exchanges and cause billions of dollars in losses, the exchanges become insolvent and are unable to return users' funds.\n\nWhen using a custodian wallet from an exchange, make sure to take the following into consideration:\n\n1.  The security standards of the exchange. Your funds are only as safe as the exchange is, so make sure it follows high security standards. Unfortunately, many exchanges have been hacked in the past and lost millions of dollars.\n2. That your funds are backed 1:1. Take a look at the wallet addresses of the exchange and make sure there is the same amount of cryptocurrency present as the exchange claims.\n3. Diversify your account holdings among multiple exchanges. This way, if one exchange goes under, you won't lose all your funds.\n\nBeware of keeping your cryptocurrency on exchanges or with third-party custodians. Many companies in the past have gone bankrupt after making risky bets with their customers' funds, including FTX, BlockFi, Celsius, and Voyager.\n\nThere is a saying in the cryptocurrency world: \"Not your keys, not your coins.\" This means that if you don't own the private keys to your cryptocurrency, you don't really own it. Therefore, it's important to store your crypto in a safe place where only you have access to it.\n\nCustodian wallets have certain advantages, such as:\n\n1. They're beginner-friendly, and users can stick to their old way of using email/password to login.\n2. They offer an easy way to exchange fiat currency for cryptocurrency, and vice versa.\n3. They have customer service departments that you can call if you experience any technical issues.\n4. They're easy to reset or gain access to if you forget your password.\n\nWe've mentioned all the risks and also the benefits of these exchanges. We hope you'll be able to make an educated decision now about whether or not you need to use a custodian wallet.",

      "content": "## Non Custodial Wallets\nNon-custodial wallets have a big advantage over custodial wallets - with non-custodial wallets, the private key is with the user and no one else. The user retains complete control over their wallet at all times. This limits the potential for misuse/control of your private keys, and in extension, your funds by some third party entity. \n\nThis improves safety since you are no longer counting on the third party having good security measures in order to protect your funds. This also means that no central entity can control who you can and cannot transfer assets to.\n\nIn 2022, many exchanges went bankrupt, causing customers to lose their funds. However, users who had their crypto in non-custodial wallets were safe.\n\nAlthough non-custodial wallets have many benefits, there are also some drawbacks that users should be aware of:\n\n1.  If you lose your private key, you lose your funds. This has happened to many individuals and once the private key is lost, there is no way of retrieving your funds.\n2. The user can write their private keys on a piece of paper, but the issue is that it is easily destructible, easy to lose, and can be read by anyone.\n3. Many non-custodial wallets are susceptible to hacks.\n4.  Many non-custodial wallets store private keys on your personal laptop or mobile device. If a hacker were to gain access to your laptop or phone, they would also have access to your sensitive private keys.\n5. Inheritance can be a difficult process with non-custodial wallets. If most of your life savings are stored in a non-custodial wallet, how can you be sure that your loved ones will be able to inherit your funds after you pass away?\n\nNon custodial wallets also come in multiple flavours\n\n\n1. Hot Storage – Private key is held online\n2. Cold Storage – Private key is held offline\n3. Hardware Wallet – Private key is held offline on a physical device\n\nThere are currently two types of accounts in Ethereum:\n\n1. Externally owned accounts (EOAs) - these are controlled by private keys\n2. Smart contract accounts - these are controlled by code\n\nSo far we have only discussed EOAs, which can hold funds. However, it is also possible for smart contracts to hold and send funds. This is the beauty of Ethereum - something that is not possible in the current financial world.\n\nWe can create smart programs which act as user accounts, otherwise known as smart contracts. These smart contracts can have different logic and conditions based on the user's needs. For example, we can have logic to limit the amount of withdrawals, or time-based limitations, or any other complex logic.\n\nSmart contract wallets, or \"smart wallets\", are simply smart contracts that behave like a wallet. This means they provide users with an interface to manage their funds, sign in with web3, and interact with dapps. Unlike private key wallets, smart wallets come with an initial cost to create, as a smart contract needs to be deployed on-chain.\n\nMulti-signature smart contract wallets are becoming increasingly popular as they require the signature from M-of-N keys to execute a transaction. This adds a layer of security and also protects the user in case they loose their private keys.This is quite reassuring for users. \n\nIn addition, there are now a few non-custodial wallets that hide the complexity of dealing with a private key away from the user. These wallets still use the public/private key pair, but the details of how the private key is stored and retrieved are abstracted away from the users. Some of these wallets are Argent, ZenGo, Ambire, and Web3Auth.\n\nThere is another type of cryptographic wallet called a Multi-Party Computation (MPC) enabled wallet. With this type of wallet, the shares or parts of the private key are distributed to a group of people. In order for a transaction to be signed, M-of-N users need to sign it with their own share of the private key. This is quite different from a Smart Contract wallet, but it has some of the same advantages.",
