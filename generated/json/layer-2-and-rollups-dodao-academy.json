      "content": "The unprecedented demand for Ethereum network, led to extraordinarily high gas fees, that made it expensive for regular users to pay for their transactions.\n\nThe Ethereum network currently has a transaction speed of around 30 (in year 2022) transactions per second. The network frequently becomes overcrowded as a result, which occasionally causes gas prices to reach extremely high levels and constant delay in transactions. This major problem of scalability can be overcomed using layers2 frameworks. Layer 2 refers to a framework or protocol of off-chain solutions  built on top of layer 1s to solve the problem of transaction speed and scaling difficulties faced by almost all cryptocurrency networks. It plays a significant part in enhancing scaling. Layer 2 solutions provide a mechanism to scale and speed up transactions while retaining the main chain's security. They have the capacity to execute thousands of transactions per second, which is essential if Ethereum is to gain main stream adoption. One of the key benefits of employing off-chain solutions is that no structural changes  are necessary in the main chain, because the second layer is simply introduced as an extra layer.\n\nLayer-2 networks are composed of two parts: \n\n1. A network that processes transactions \n2. A smart contract on the underlying blockchain that settles disputes and achieves consensus on the state of the layer-2 network. The smart contract \"cements\" the layer-2 network to the underlying blockchain.\n\nThere are two main functions of the smart contract are:\n\n\n\n1. Holding and releasing funds that are transferred to the layer\n2. Receiving proofs from the layer 2, validating them, resolving disputes, and finalizing transactions\n\n**The most famous type of layer 2 implementations is Rollups**",

      "content": "Roll up is a type of layer two solution  to solve the Ethereum scalability problem Roll ups works by executing transactions outside the main ethereum  chain, while submitting data to the base chain.This means that layer-2 networks can handle the processing of transactions much faster than the base blockchain, since there is a smaller validator set with better hardware. In addition, the base blockchain only needs to execute proofs submitted to the rollup smart contract to verify the activity on the layer-2 network, rather than store raw, unexecuted transaction data.\n\nOptimistic and zero-knowledge rollups provide higher scalability by executing smart contract state changes off-chain and proving them on-chain. Rollups improve scalability in two ways: \n\n1. **Off-Chain Execution** - Rollups move transaction execution off-chain, so that the underlying base blockchain only needs to verify network activity with small proofs and store raw transaction data. \n2. **Batch Transactions** - Rollups group multiple transactions together when submitted to a blockchain, so that the on-chain gas cost is spread out over many transactions.\n3. **Fewer Validators** - Rollups require a minimum of one honest validator to prove the validity of transactions to the base layer blockchain. This allows for smaller validator sets and increased hardware requirements without compromising security.\n\nRollups shift computation (and state storage) off-chain, but still require some data per transaction to remain on-chain. For example, an Ethereum base-layer ERC20 token transfer costs approximately 45,000 gas. In contrast, an ERC20 transfer in a rollup only takes up 16 bytes of on-chain space and costs less than 300 gas.\n\nSince data resides on-chain and there is consensus around this fact, anyone can locally process all the operations in the rollup if they choose to do so. This allows them to detect fraud, initiate withdrawals, or start producing transaction batches themselves.",

Cryptographic proofs provide clear, verifiable, and tamper-proof evidence that something is true. \n\nThe most well-known proof or validation techniques today are \n### 1) Fault proofs (optimistic) \nIn this type validators are responsible for validating commitments posted to the bridge contract. There is a challenge time window to provide time for a challenger to send indisputable evidence (proof of fraud) about the commitmentâ€™s validity. If there is no evidence of fraud by the time the challenge expires, then the commitment is accepted as valid.\n\n\n### 2) Validity proofs (also called zero-knowledge proofs). \nZero-knowledge proofs allow the prover to show that a commitment is valid without revealing any information about the inputs. This proof can be verified quickly and easily, making it a valuable tool for ensuring computational integrity. ",
