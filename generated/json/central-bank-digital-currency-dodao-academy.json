This form of money is exclusively available in electronic format only. \n\nElectronic currencies are widely used around the globe and are present in the financial systems of almost all countries. The prime difference between Digital currency and Electronic currency is that digital currency in a person’s bank account never takes a physical form.\n\nFor example, A person can go to their ATM can convert the electronic money in their bank account into cash whereas digital currency never leaves the computer network and can only transfer via a digital medium.\n\nDigital currencies are of three types mainly: cryptocurrency, stablecoins and central bank digital currencies i.e. CBDCs. All cryptocurrencies are digital currencies whereas all digital currencies are not cryptocurrencies.\n\nCBDCs are digital tokens that a country's government backs and their value is derived from the country’s fiat currency. Many countries are recently developing their own CBDCs. Some currently available CBDCs are Central Bank of The Bahamas (Sand Dollar), the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (DCash), the Central Bank of Nigeria (e-Naira) and the Bank of Jamaica (JamDex).",

Still, thanks to technology, governments and financial institutions can now use a credit-based model where balances and transactions are recorded digitally to augment physical fiat money.\n\nThe physical form of currency is widely used around the globe, but there has been a decline in its usage due to the COVID-19 academic. Thus governments are exploring the possibility of incorporating digital currencies into their financial systems.\n\nThere are several key differences between CBDC and fiat currency:\n1. CBDC is a digital form of money, while fiat currency is typically physical or electronic.\n2. CBDC is issued and backed by the central bank, while fiat currency is issued and backed by the government.\n3. CBDC is intended to provide a convenient and secure way to make digital transactions, while fiat currency is accepted as legal tender by the government that issues it.\n4. CBDC is still in the development and testing phase, while fiat currency is widely used and accepted.\n\nCBDC is a legal tender issued by a central bank in digital form. It is the same as fiat currency. It is exchangeable one-to-one with the fiat currency. ",

The general stability of an economy could be impacted by this volatility, which could put many households under significant financial strain.

Wholesale CBDC is intended to provide a more efficient and secure way to make large-value payments and settle transactions and is not accessible to the general public.\n2. **Retail CBDC** - this is a digital currency that is issued and used by the general public and is intended to be used for everyday transactions, such as buying goods and services, paying bills, and transferring money. Retail CBDC can be accessed by individuals and businesses and is intended to provide a more convenient and secure alternative to physical cash and electronic money.\n\nSome central banks are also considering other types of CBDC, such as a hybrid model that combines elements of both wholesale and retail CBDC, or a two-tier model where the central bank issues the digital currency, but it is distributed and used by commercial banks and other intermediaries. These different models may offer different benefits and challenges, and central banks are still exploring the best approach for their specific contexts and needs.",

These issues need to be carefully considered and resolved to ensure that CBDC is safe, fair, and effective.\n3. **Monetary and financial stability risks** - CBDC may have implications for the broader monetary and financial system, such as how it will affect the demand for physical cash, the supply of money, and the transmission of monetary policy. Central banks need to carefully assess and manage these risks to ensure that CBDC does not destabilize the economy or create financial imbalances.\n4. **Privacy and data protection concerns** - CBDC may generate large amounts of data and information about individuals' and businesses' financial transactions, which could be used for surveillance, fraud, or other purposes. Central banks and other authorities need to ensure that CBDC is designed and implemented in a way that protects individuals' privacy and data rights.",

In August 2021, Jamaica produced its first batch of CBDC. In 2022, the Bank of Jamaica is anticipated to introduce its CBDC.\n\nIn order to enhance the domestic payments system, boost productivity, and cut expenses, the United States is looking at CBDCs. In March 2022, President Biden issued a directive to federal agencies to assess the infrastructure required to issue a U.S. CBDC.

This provides greater autonomy and independence from governments and central banks and allows individuals and businesses to make transactions and transfers without intermediaries or restrictions.\n2. **Global reach and accessibility** - cryptocurrency can be used and traded anywhere in the world, without the need for borders, currencies, or intermediaries. This makes it more accessible and convenient for individuals and businesses in different countries and jurisdictions and allows for faster and cheaper international transactions.\n3. **Privacy and anonymity** - cryptocurrency can provide greater privacy and anonymity for users, allowing them to make transactions and transfers without revealing their identity or personal information. This can be particularly useful for individuals and businesses that value privacy and want to avoid surveillance or censorship.\n4. **Censorship resistance** - cryptocurrency is not subject to censorship or control by governments or central banks and can be used for transactions and transfers even in countries or situations where traditional financial systems are restricted or blocked.

On the other hand from a global financial perspective crypto is better and no single entity controls it. Things like government manipulation of the economy will still exist in CBDC as we saw in the case of the pandemic, money was printed and then later the interest rates were increased. Many individuals were caught by this change in macroeconomics.\n",
