## Central Bank Digital Currency


## What is digital Currency?

Any form of currency that is accessible with computers or mobile phones. This form of money is exclusively available in electronic format only. 

Electronic currencies are widely used around the globe and are present in the financial systems of almost all countries. The prime difference between Digital currency and Electronic currency is that digital currency in a person’s bank account never takes a physical form.

For example, A person can go to their ATM can convert the electronic money in their bank account into cash whereas digital currency never leaves the computer network and can only transfer via a digital medium.

Digital currencies are of three types mainly: cryptocurrency, stablecoins and central bank digital currencies i.e. CBDCs. All cryptocurrencies are digital currencies whereas all digital currencies are not cryptocurrencies.

CBDCs are digital tokens that a country's government backs and their value is derived from the country’s fiat currency. Many countries are recently developing their own CBDCs. Some currently available CBDCs are Central Bank of The Bahamas (Sand Dollar), the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (DCash), the Central Bank of Nigeria (e-Naira) and the Bank of Jamaica (JamDex).

## Understanding CBDC

A government-issued currency known as "fiat money" is not backed by tangible assets like gold or silver. It is regarded as a type of acceptable legal money that can be used to transact goods and services. Fiat money has always been issued as banknotes and coins. Still, thanks to technology, governments and financial institutions can now use a credit-based model where balances and transactions are recorded digitally to augment physical fiat money.

The physical form of currency is widely used around the globe, but there has been a decline in its usage due to the COVID-19 academic. Thus governments are exploring the possibility of incorporating digital currencies into their financial systems.

There are several key differences between CBDC and fiat currency:
1. CBDC is a digital form of money, while fiat currency is typically physical or electronic.
2. CBDC is issued and backed by the central bank, while fiat currency is issued and backed by the government.
3. CBDC is intended to provide a convenient and secure way to make digital transactions, while fiat currency is accepted as legal tender by the government that issues it.
4. CBDC is still in the development and testing phase, while fiat currency is widely used and accepted.

CBDC is a legal tender issued by a central bank in digital form. It is the same as fiat currency. It is exchangeable one-to-one with the fiat currency.

## Goals of CBDCs

The prime objective of CBDCs is to offer financial security, privacy, transferability, simplicity, and accessibility to businesses and consumers. CBDCs may also minimize the cost of cross-border transactions, and lower the expense of maintaining a complicated financial system. 

There are several potential benefits of central bank digital currency (CBDC), including:
1. **Increased convenience and accessibility** - CBDC can be easily accessed and used for digital transactions, providing a more convenient and accessible way for individuals and businesses to make payments and transfer money.
2. **Enhanced security and fraud prevention** - CBDC can use advanced security features and cryptography to prevent fraud and protect against cyber attacks, making it safer than physical cash or traditional electronic payments.
3. **Increased competition and innovation** - CBDC can enable new and innovative forms of digital payments and financial services, promoting competition and innovation in the financial sector.
4. **Improved financial inclusion** - CBDC can provide access to financial services for individuals and businesses that may not have access to traditional banking services, promoting financial inclusion and reducing inequality.
5. **Greater control and stability** - CBDC can provide central banks with greater control over the money supply and interest rates, and can help to stabilize the economy and promote financial stability in times of crisis or volatility.

When CBDCs are compared to cryptocurrencies, the value of cryptocurrencies constantly fluctuates and thus makes them volatile assets. The general stability of an economy could be impacted by this volatility, which could put many households under significant financial strain. CBDCs would offer people and businesses a secure way to exchange digital currency because they are backed by the government and regulated by a central bank.

## Types of CBDCs

CBDCs come in two varieties: wholesale and retail. The main users of wholesale CBDCs are financial institutions. Retail CBDCs are utilised by customers and businesses in a manner similar to that of physical forms of money.

There are two main types of central bank digital currency (CBDC):
1. **Wholesale CBDC** - this is a digital currency that is issued and used by financial institutions and other large market participants, such as banks, payment providers, and clearing houses. Wholesale CBDC is intended to provide a more efficient and secure way to make large-value payments and settle transactions and is not accessible to the general public.
2. **Retail CBDC** - this is a digital currency that is issued and used by the general public and is intended to be used for everyday transactions, such as buying goods and services, paying bills, and transferring money. Retail CBDC can be accessed by individuals and businesses and is intended to provide a more convenient and secure alternative to physical cash and electronic money.

Some central banks are also considering other types of CBDC, such as a hybrid model that combines elements of both wholesale and retail CBDC, or a two-tier model where the central bank issues the digital currency, but it is distributed and used by commercial banks and other intermediaries. These different models may offer different benefits and challenges, and central banks are still exploring the best approach for their specific contexts and needs.

## Challenges with CBDCS

There are several challenges faced by central bank digital currencies (CBDC), including:
1. **Technological complexity** - developing and implementing CBDC involves complex technology, including secure digital wallets, payment networks, and cryptographic algorithms. This requires significant investment, expertise, and collaboration among different stakeholders, and may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks or other technical failures.
2. **Legal and regulatory uncertainty** - CBDC raises many legal and regulatory questions, such as how it will interact with existing laws and regulations, who will be responsible for its issuance and oversight, and how it will be taxed and accounted for. These issues need to be carefully considered and resolved to ensure that CBDC is safe, fair, and effective.
3. **Monetary and financial stability risks** - CBDC may have implications for the broader monetary and financial system, such as how it will affect the demand for physical cash, the supply of money, and the transmission of monetary policy. Central banks need to carefully assess and manage these risks to ensure that CBDC does not destabilize the economy or create financial imbalances.
4. **Privacy and data protection concerns** - CBDC may generate large amounts of data and information about individuals' and businesses' financial transactions, which could be used for surveillance, fraud, or other purposes. Central banks and other authorities need to ensure that CBDC is designed and implemented in a way that protects individuals' privacy and data rights.

## Worldwide CBDCs scenario

Many central banks around the globe have CBDC research and projects under progress. They are exploring the usability and viability of a CBDC in their economy and how it will benefit their country’s financial system. As of March 2022, there were nine countries and territories that had launched CBDCs.
* The Bahamas
* Antigua and Barbuda
* St. Kitts and Nevis
* Monserrat
* Dominica
* Saint Lucia
* St. Vincent and the Grenadines
* Grenada
* Nigeria

As of 2021, only a handful of countries have introduced central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) for general use. These include

1. The Bahamas, which launched the world's first CBDC, the Sand Dollar, in 2020
2. China, which launched the Digital Yuan in 2020 and is currently conducting pilot tests
3. Sweden is exploring the potential use of the e-krona as a complement to cash
4. The United Arab Emirates, which launched the emCash in 2018
5. Uruguay introduced the e-peso in 2017

In February 2022, during the budget speech, the Indian Finance Minister announced that it would introduce a digital currency by the end of 2023. In August 2021, Jamaica produced its first batch of CBDC. In 2022, the Bank of Jamaica is anticipated to introduce its CBDC.

In order to enhance the domestic payments system, boost productivity, and cut expenses, the United States is looking at CBDCs. In March 2022, President Biden issued a directive to federal agencies to assess the infrastructure required to issue a U.S. CBDC. Bank of England (BOE) and Bank of Canada (BOC) are continuing their research for implementing CBDC into their financial systems.

## CBDC vs Cryptocurrency

Central bank digital currency (CBDC) and cryptocurrency are both forms of digital money, but there are several key differences between them:

1. **Issuance and backing** - CBDC is issued and backed by the central bank of a country, while cryptocurrency is typically issued and backed by a decentralized network of computers and users.
2. **Legal status and acceptance** - CBDC is a legal form of money that is accepted as legal tender by the government that issues it, while cryptocurrency is not recognized as legal tender by most governments, and its acceptance and use may be limited or prohibited in some countries.
3. **Monetary policy and regulation** - CBDC is subject to monetary policy and regulation by the central bank and other authorities, while cryptocurrency is typically not subject to monetary policy or law, and its supply and value are determined by market forces.

There are several potential benefits of cryptocurrency over central bank digital currency (CBDC), including:

1. **Decentralization and autonomy** - cryptocurrency is issued and managed by decentralized networks of users and miners, without any central authority or backing. This provides greater autonomy and independence from governments and central banks and allows individuals and businesses to make transactions and transfers without intermediaries or restrictions.
2. **Global reach and accessibility** - cryptocurrency can be used and traded anywhere in the world, without the need for borders, currencies, or intermediaries. This makes it more accessible and convenient for individuals and businesses in different countries and jurisdictions and allows for faster and cheaper international transactions.
3. **Privacy and anonymity** - cryptocurrency can provide greater privacy and anonymity for users, allowing them to make transactions and transfers without revealing their identity or personal information. This can be particularly useful for individuals and businesses that value privacy and want to avoid surveillance or censorship.
4. **Censorship resistance** - cryptocurrency is not subject to censorship or control by governments or central banks and can be used for transactions and transfers even in countries or situations where traditional financial systems are restricted or blocked. This can be particularly useful for individuals and businesses that operate in repressive or unstable environments.

## Conclusion

Countries having a weaker and vulnerable financial system will not benefit from CBDC as firstly it will not be implemented, and secondly, it will still be in control of the centralized entity that led to a weaker financial model in the first place. 

In the view of developed nations, it looks like CBDC is better as it provides regulation and safety from funds getting lost. On the other hand from a global financial perspective crypto is better and no single entity controls it. Things like government manipulation of the economy will still exist in CBDC as we saw in the case of the pandemic, money was printed and then later the interest rates were increased. Many individuals were caught by this change in macroeconomics.
