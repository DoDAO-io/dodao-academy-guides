These strategies are also useful for hedging the downside risk of a portfolio or specific stocks. Although these two investment methods have common characteristics, there are also differences that investors should understand.\n\n## Short Selling\nShort selling is the sale of securities that the seller does not own, but has borrowed, in the market and buys them back later, which can result in significant losses if the market rises.\_\n\n\n## Put Option\nPurchasing a put option gives the purchaser the right to sell the underlying asset at the price specified in the option with the maximum loss being the premium paid for the option."

      Short selling is far riskier than purchasing puts. With short sales, the
      reward may be limited, as at max stock can decline to zero, but the risk
      is potentially unlimited, because the stock's value may rise infinitely.


      Despite the risks, short selling can be an effective strategy during a
      broad bear market, as stocks typically fall faster than they rise.
      Additionally, shorting may carry slightly less risk when the security
      being shorted is an index or ETF, as the risk of a sharp rally in the
      entire index is usually lower than for an individual stock.


      Short selling is generally more expensive than buying puts due to the fact
      that margin requirements are often higher. Margin trading allows traders
      to take out a loan from their broker in order to finance the purchase of
      an asset. Because of the inherent risks involved, not all trading accounts
      are allowed to trade on margin. Your broker will require you to have the
      necessary funds in your account to cover your shorts. As the price of the
      asset shorted begins to climb, the broker will also increase the value of
      the margin that the trader is required to hold.
