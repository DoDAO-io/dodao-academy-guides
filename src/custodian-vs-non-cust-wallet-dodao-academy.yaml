      To get started with financial transactions, one needs to have a bank
      account. Similarly, to get started with cryptocurrency, one needs to have
      a crypto wallet.



      ## Crypto Wallets


      A crypto wallet is made up of two parts - the public key and the private
      key. The public key is like your account number at a bank, and is used by
      other crypto users to send funds into your account. The private key is
      like your netbanking PIN, and is necessary to send funds out of your
      account. If someone gets hold of your private keys, they can move funds
      from your address to anywhere else. So, it's really important to store
      your private keys safely!


      For non-technical users, this may sound daunting and even for tech-savvy
      users, the idea of losing a private key is scary. We're all used to using
      an email/username password for our accounts and it's okay to forget those
      occasionally. If we lose every detail of our bank account, we can usually
      go to a physical bank branch and have someone help us reset our access.
      But this type of setup isn't possible with blockchain/cryptocurrency, and
      that's what keeps a lot of users away.


      There are many websites that allow you to easily buy cryptocurrency, and
      many of these use the traditional email/password approach. But since
      blockchain technology doesn't allow for this, how are these sites able to
      provide such an easy way to access and buy crypto? Are there any risks
      from using these websites? We will answer all of these questions in this
      guide/article.


      As mentioned earlier, the gateway to accessing the financial world is a
      bank account. In the same way, the gateway to accessing the crypto world
      is a wallet. Crypto wallets can be divided into two categories: 


      1. Custodial Wallets - Custodial wallets are a type of cryptocurrency
      wallet where the private keys are held by a third party. This third party
      can be an exchange, a custodian, or another type of organization.
      Custodial wallets are often seen as an easy way for new users to get
      started with cryptocurrency, but there are several risks that come with
      using this type of wallet. We will be looking at these risks in detail in
      the next section

      2. Non-Custodial Wallets - With this type of wallet, you are in control of
      the tokens or cryptocurrency you purchase. This approach appears to be
      more promising, but also has many complexities that come with it.


      In this article, we will outline the advantages and disadvantages of
      custodial and non-custodial wallets without attempting to compare them
      with one another.

      ## Custodial Wallets

      If you're just getting started with cryptocurrency, you might be already
      using a custodian wallet. With this type of wallet, your private keys are
      held by a centralized organization - usually an exchange. These exchanges
      allow you to convert fiat currency to cryptocurrency (and vice versa).


      Many people worry that if they don't hold onto their private keys,
      somebody else might cheat them. And they're right to be worried - we've
      seen countless examples of billions of dollars being lost by customers
      because of the poor business decisions of centralized
      organizations/exchanges.


      Not all centralized crypto organizations are created equal - much like
      banks. Most banks are regulated and individuals' money is insured by the
      government in most cases. However, many centralized crypto organizations
      are not regulated and have been known to make bad business decisions that
      result in customers losing their funds. Some crypto exchanges are
      regulated and audited by the government, though. Coinbase is one such
      exchange that is both regulated and audited by the government.


      Since many cryptocurrency exchanges are not regulated, meaning they don't
      have to hold customers' funds in a 1:1 ratio. This means they can use
      customer crypto to buy other assets and engage in high-risk bets. If these
      bets pay off, the customer is happy and the exchange makes a lot of money.
      But when these highly leveraged bets go against the exchanges and cause
      billions of dollars in losses, the exchanges become insolvent and are
      unable to return users' funds.


      When using a custodian wallet from an exchange, make sure to take the
      following into consideration:


      1.  The security standards of the exchange. Your funds are only as safe as
      the exchange is, so make sure it follows high security standards.
      Unfortunately, many exchanges have been hacked in the past and lost
      millions of dollars.

      2. That your funds are backed 1:1. Take a look at the wallet addresses of
      the exchange and make sure there is the same amount of cryptocurrency
      present as the exchange claims.

      3. Diversify your account holdings among multiple exchanges. This way, if
      one exchange goes under, you won't lose all your funds.


      Beware of keeping your cryptocurrency on exchanges or with third-party
      custodians. Many companies in the past have gone bankrupt after making
      risky bets with their customers' funds, including FTX, BlockFi, Celsius,
      and Voyager.


      There is a saying in the cryptocurrency world: "Not your keys, not your
      coins." This means that if you don't own the private keys to your
      cryptocurrency, you don't really own it. Therefore, it's important to
      store your crypto in a safe place where only you have access to it.


      Custodian wallets have certain advantages, such as:


      1. They're beginner-friendly, and users can stick to their old way of
      using email/password to login.

      2. They offer an easy way to exchange fiat currency for cryptocurrency,
      and vice versa.

      3. They have customer service departments that you can call if you
      experience any technical issues.

      4. They're easy to reset or gain access to if you forget your password.


      We've mentioned all the risks and also the benefits of these exchanges. We
      hope you'll be able to make an educated decision now about whether or not
      you need to use a custodian wallet.
