      To get started with financial transactions, one needs to have a bank
      account. Similarly, to get started with cryptocurrency, one needs to have
      a crypto wallet.



      ## Crypto Wallets


      A crypto wallet is made up of two parts - the public key and the private
      key. The public key is like your account number at a bank, and is used by
      other crypto users to send funds into your account. The private key is
      like your netbanking PIN, and is necessary to send funds out of your
      account. If someone gets hold of your private keys, they can move funds
      from your address to anywhere else. So, it's really important to store
      your private keys safely!


      For non-technical users, this may sound daunting and even for tech-savvy
      users, the idea of losing a private key is scary. We're all used to using
      an email/username password for our accounts and it's okay to forget those
      occasionally. If we lose every detail of our bank account, we can usually
      go to a physical bank branch and have someone help us reset our access.
      But this type of setup isn't possible with blockchain/cryptocurrency, and
      that's what keeps a lot of users away.


      There are many websites that allow you to easily buy cryptocurrency, and
      many of these use the traditional email/password approach. But since
      blockchain technology doesn't allow for this, how are these sites able to
      provide such an easy way to access and buy crypto? Are there any risks
      from using these websites? We will answer all of these questions in this
      guide/article.


      As mentioned earlier, the gateway to accessing the financial world is a
      bank account. In the same way, the gateway to accessing the crypto world
      is a wallet. Crypto wallets can be divided into two categories: 


      1. Custodial Wallets - Custodial wallets are a type of cryptocurrency
      wallet where the private keys are held by a third party. This third party
      can be an exchange, a custodian, or another type of organization.
      Custodial wallets are often seen as an easy way for new users to get
      started with cryptocurrency, but there are several risks that come with
      using this type of wallet. We will be looking at these risks in detail in
      the next section

      2. Non-Custodial Wallets - With this type of wallet, you are in control of
      the tokens or cryptocurrency you purchase. This approach appears to be
      more promising, but also has many complexities that come with it.


      In this article, we will outline the advantages and disadvantages of
      custodial and non-custodial wallets without attempting to compare them
      with one another.

      ## Custodial Wallets

      If you're just getting started with cryptocurrency, you might be already
      using a custodian wallet. With this type of wallet, your private keys are
      held by a centralized organization - usually an exchange. These exchanges
      allow you to convert fiat currency to cryptocurrency (and vice versa).


      Many people worry that if they don't hold onto their private keys,
      somebody else might cheat them. And they're right to be worried - we've
      seen countless examples of billions of dollars being lost by customers
      because of the poor business decisions of centralized
      organizations/exchanges.


      Not all centralized crypto organizations are created equal - much like
      banks. Most banks are regulated and individuals' money is insured by the
      government in most cases. However, many centralized crypto organizations
      are not regulated and have been known to make bad business decisions that
      result in customers losing their funds. Some crypto exchanges are
      regulated and audited by the government, though. Coinbase is one such
      exchange that is both regulated and audited by the government.


      Since many cryptocurrency exchanges are not regulated, meaning they don't
      have to hold customers' funds in a 1:1 ratio. This means they can use
      customer crypto to buy other assets and engage in high-risk bets. If these
      bets pay off, the customer is happy and the exchange makes a lot of money.
      But when these highly leveraged bets go against the exchanges and cause
      billions of dollars in losses, the exchanges become insolvent and are
      unable to return users' funds.


      When using a custodian wallet from an exchange, make sure to take the
      following into consideration:


      1.  The security standards of the exchange. Your funds are only as safe as
      the exchange is, so make sure it follows high security standards.
      Unfortunately, many exchanges have been hacked in the past and lost
      millions of dollars.

      2. That your funds are backed 1:1. Take a look at the wallet addresses of
      the exchange and make sure there is the same amount of cryptocurrency
      present as the exchange claims.

      3. Diversify your account holdings among multiple exchanges. This way, if
      one exchange goes under, you won't lose all your funds.


      Beware of keeping your cryptocurrency on exchanges or with third-party
      custodians. Many companies in the past have gone bankrupt after making
      risky bets with their customers' funds, including FTX, BlockFi, Celsius,
      and Voyager.


      There is a saying in the cryptocurrency world: "Not your keys, not your
      coins." This means that if you don't own the private keys to your
      cryptocurrency, you don't really own it. Therefore, it's important to
      store your crypto in a safe place where only you have access to it.


      Custodian wallets have certain advantages, such as:


      1. They're beginner-friendly, and users can stick to their old way of
      using email/password to login.

      2. They offer an easy way to exchange fiat currency for cryptocurrency,
      and vice versa.

      3. They have customer service departments that you can call if you
      experience any technical issues.

      4. They're easy to reset or gain access to if you forget your password.


      We've mentioned all the risks and also the benefits of these exchanges. We
      hope you'll be able to make an educated decision now about whether or not
      you need to use a custodian wallet.

      ## Non Custodial Wallets

      Non-custodial wallets have a big advantage over custodial wallets - with
      non-custodial wallets, the private key is with the user and no one else.
      The user retains complete control over their wallet at all times. This
      limits the potential for misuse/control of your private keys, and in
      extension, your funds by some third party entity. 


      This improves safety since you are no longer counting on the third party
      having good security measures in order to protect your funds. This also
      means that no central entity can control who you can and cannot transfer
      assets to.


      In 2022, many exchanges went bankrupt, causing customers to lose their
      funds. However, users who had their crypto in non-custodial wallets were
      safe.


      Although non-custodial wallets have many benefits, there are also some
      drawbacks that users should be aware of:


      1.  If you lose your private key, you lose your funds. This has happened
      to many individuals and once the private key is lost, there is no way of
      retrieving your funds.

      2. The user can write their private keys on a piece of paper, but the
      issue is that it is easily destructible, easy to lose, and can be read by
      anyone.

      3. Many non-custodial wallets are susceptible to hacks.

      4.  Many non-custodial wallets store private keys on your personal laptop
      or mobile device. If a hacker were to gain access to your laptop or phone,
      they would also have access to your sensitive private keys.

      5. Inheritance can be a difficult process with non-custodial wallets. If
      most of your life savings are stored in a non-custodial wallet, how can
      you be sure that your loved ones will be able to inherit your funds after
      you pass away?


      Non custodial wallets also come in multiple flavours



      1. Hot Storage – Private key is held online

      2. Cold Storage – Private key is held offline

      3. Hardware Wallet – Private key is held offline on a physical device


      There are currently two types of accounts in Ethereum:


      1. Externally owned accounts (EOAs) - these are controlled by private keys

      2. Smart contract accounts - these are controlled by code


      So far we have only discussed EOAs, which can hold funds. However, it is
      also possible for smart contracts to hold and send funds. This is the
      beauty of Ethereum - something that is not possible in the current
      financial world.


      We can create smart programs which act as user accounts, otherwise known
      as smart contracts. These smart contracts can have different logic and
      conditions based on the user's needs. For example, we can have logic to
      limit the amount of withdrawals, or time-based limitations, or any other
      complex logic.


      Smart contract wallets, or "smart wallets", are simply smart contracts
      that behave like a wallet. This means they provide users with an interface
      to manage their funds, sign in with web3, and interact with dapps. Unlike
      private key wallets, smart wallets come with an initial cost to create, as
      a smart contract needs to be deployed on-chain.


      Multi-signature smart contract wallets are becoming increasingly popular
      as they require the signature from M-of-N keys to execute a transaction.
      This adds a layer of security and also protects the user in case they
      loose their private keys.This is quite reassuring for users. 


      In addition, there are now a few non-custodial wallets that hide the
      complexity of dealing with a private key away from the user. These wallets
      still use the public/private key pair, but the details of how the private
      key is stored and retrieved are abstracted away from the users. Some of
      these wallets are Argent, ZenGo, Ambire, and Web3Auth.


      There is another type of cryptographic wallet called a Multi-Party
      Computation (MPC) enabled wallet. With this type of wallet, the shares or
      parts of the private key are distributed to a group of people. In order
      for a transaction to be signed, M-of-N users need to sign it with their
      own share of the private key. This is quite different from a Smart
      Contract wallet, but it has some of the same advantages.
