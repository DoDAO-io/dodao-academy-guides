      The unprecedented demand for Ethereum network, led to extraordinarily high
      gas fees, that made it expensive for regular users to pay for their
      transactions.


      The Ethereum network currently has a transaction speed of around 30 (in
      year 2022) transactions per second. The network frequently becomes
      overcrowded as a result, which occasionally causes gas prices to reach
      extremely high levels and constant delay in transactions. This major
      problem of scalability can be overcomed using layers2 frameworks. Layer 2
      refers to a framework or protocol of off-chain solutions  built on top of
      layer 1s to solve the problem of transaction speed and scaling
      difficulties faced by almost all cryptocurrency networks. It plays a
      significant part in enhancing scaling. Layer 2 solutions provide a
      mechanism to scale and speed up transactions while retaining the main
      chain's security. They have the capacity to execute thousands of
      transactions per second, which is essential if Ethereum is to gain main
      stream adoption. One of the key benefits of employing off-chain solutions
      is that no structural changes  are necessary in the main chain, because
      the second layer is simply introduced as an extra layer.


      Layer-2 networks are composed of two parts: 


      1. A network that processes transactions 

      2. A smart contract on the underlying blockchain that settles disputes and
      achieves consensus on the state of the layer-2 network. The smart contract
      "cements" the layer-2 network to the underlying blockchain.


      There are two main functions of the smart contract are:




      1. Holding and releasing funds that are transferred to the layer

      2. Receiving proofs from the layer 2, validating them, resolving disputes,
      and finalizing transactions


      **The most famous type of layer 2 implementations is Rollups**

      Roll up is a type of layer two solution  to solve the Ethereum scalability
      problem Roll ups works by executing transactions outside the main
      ethereum  chain, while submitting data to the base chain.This means that
      layer-2 networks can handle the processing of transactions much faster
      than the base blockchain, since there is a smaller validator set with
      better hardware. In addition, the base blockchain only needs to execute
      proofs submitted to the rollup smart contract to verify the activity on
      the layer-2 network, rather than store raw, unexecuted transaction data.


      In a rollup, all data is posted to the Layer-1 blockchain. This is because
      “computation is expensive but data is cheap on Ethereum”.


      Optimistic and zero-knowledge rollups provide higher scalability by
      executing smart contract state changes off-chain and proving them
      on-chain. Rollups improve scalability in two ways: 


      1. **Off-Chain Execution** - Rollups move transaction execution off-chain,
      so that the underlying base blockchain only needs to verify network
      activity with small proofs and store raw transaction data. 

      2. **Batch Transactions** - Rollups group multiple transactions together
      when submitted to a blockchain, so that the on-chain gas cost is spread
      out over many transactions.

      3. **Fewer Validators** - Rollups require a minimum of one honest
      validator to prove the validity of transactions to the base layer
      blockchain. This allows for smaller validator sets and increased hardware
      requirements without compromising security.


      Rollups shift computation (and state storage) off-chain, but still require
      some data per transaction to remain on-chain. For example, an Ethereum
      base-layer ERC20 token transfer costs approximately 45,000 gas. In
      contrast, an ERC20 transfer in a rollup only takes up 16 bytes of on-chain
      space and costs less than 300 gas.


      Since data resides on-chain and there is consensus around this fact,
      anyone can locally process all the operations in the rollup if they choose
      to do so. This allows them to detect fraud, initiate withdrawals, or start
      producing transaction batches themselves.

      "Proof/Validation" is a key concept for layer 2s that want to take
      advantage of the security benefits offered by a base chain. Cryptographic
      proofs provide clear, verifiable, and tamper-proof evidence that something
      is true. 


      The most well-known proof or validation techniques today are 

      ### 1) Fault proofs (optimistic) 

      In this type validators are responsible for validating commitments posted
      to the bridge contract. There is a challenge time window to provide time
      for a challenger to send indisputable evidence (proof of fraud) about the
      commitment’s validity. If there is no evidence of fraud by the time the
      challenge expires, then the commitment is accepted as valid.



      ### 2) Validity proofs (also called zero-knowledge proofs). 

      Zero-knowledge proofs allow the prover to show that a commitment is valid
      without revealing any information about the inputs. This proof can be
      verified quickly and easily, making it a valuable tool for ensuring
      computational integrity.
