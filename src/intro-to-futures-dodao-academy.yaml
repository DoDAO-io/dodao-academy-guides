      ## **Define futures**


      Futures are financial derivative contracts that bind parties to buy or
      sell an asset at a specified future date and price. Regardless of the
      market price at the date of expiration, the buyer or seller must buy or
      sell the underlying asset at the agreed-upon price.


      Physical commodities and financial instruments are examples of underlying
      assets. Futures contracts are standardised to make trading on a futures
      market easier and specify the quantity of the underlying asset. Futures
      can be utilised for trade speculation or hedging.



      Futures or Futures contracts have an expiration date and their price is
      known beforehand. These contracts are identified by their expiration
      month. For example, November futures will expire in the month of November.


      ## **Types of futures**

      The term futures is used to signify a large class of assets that they
      represent. These include :
              **i)   Commodity Futures** which consist of crude oil, wheat, natural gas etc.
              **ii)  Stock index futures** with underlying assets such as the S&P 500 Index
              **iii) Currency futures** which represent British Pound and Euro
              **iv) Precious Metals** such as gold or silver
              **v)  U.S. treasury futures** with underlying bond and financial securities

      ## Explain the various details under the futures contract


      Futures contracts can be bought and sold over exchanges. These contracts
      are standardized. Each futures contract consists of various parameters
      known as contract parameters. These are:




      Futures contracts are traded on an exchange. In DeFi, most popular
      derivatives exchange is FTX. In the above capture we can se ETH-1230
      December futures being traded on the platform. The blue line represents
      (Index Price) the average of ETH prices across major exchanges and the
      candlesticks below represents the Mark price. In the right panel
      parameters such as minimum order size, expiration date and volume traded
      in last 24 hours have also been mentioned.


      ## Explain who creates these contracts

      Futures contracts are created and regulated by exchanges. These exchanges
      are responsible for the standardization of various parameters in these
      contracts. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversees futures
      markets (CFTC). In order to protect the integrity of futures market
      pricing, including prohibiting fraudulent activity and abusive trading
      methods, the CFTC is a government organization that was established by
      Congress in 1974.

      Futures can be used to hedge against price fluctuations in the underlying
      asset. In this instance, preventing losses from potentially negative price
      movements is the goal rather than engaging in speculation. Many businesses
      engage in hedging or, in certain situations, produce the underlying asset.


      Futures, for instance, can be used by maize producers to set a fixed price
      for selling their harvest. Suppose the farmer agrees to come up with a
      futures contract with a maize mill at $1000 / ton for three months to
      deliver maize. 


      Now suppose three months pass and the delivery time arrives and the spot
      price of maize is $900 / ton i.e. the prices fell. In this scenario, the
      farmer benefited because he had already hedged his position through the
      futures contract at 

      $1000 / ton of maize. In this case, the mill owner is at a loss because he
      agreed to the fixed price of $1000/ton when the current market price is
      $900/ton.


      Whereas if the sport price of maise is $1200 / ton i.e. the prices of
      maise rose. In this case, as the farmer has hedged his position so he will
      get the fixed price of the futures contract which is $1000 / ton but he
      would have sold maize to the market he would get $1200/ton. Hence the
      farmer is at a loss and the mill owner is at profit.


      Hence if the price of futures rises the seller is at a loss and the buyer
      is benefitted. On contrary, if the prices fall the seller is benefitted
      and the buyer is at a loss.

      A trader can make predictions (speculate) about the course of a
      commodity's price using a futures contract. The trader would profit if a
      futures contract and the commodity's price rose to trade above the
      contract's starting price at expiration. The futures contract—the long
      position—would be sold at the current price before expiration, so
      completing the long position.


      No actual exchange of commodity takes place, instead, the difference in
      the prices would be resolved in cash in the investor's margin account. The
      trader might suffer a loss or gain on the basis of the sport price versus
      the fixed price of the futures contract.


      A speculator may also take a short speculative position if they anticipate
      a drop in the value of the underlying asset. If the price does decline,
      the trader will adopt a contrary position to close the contract. The
      contract’s expiration will only happen when the difference between the
      prices is resolved till the expiration date. If the price of the
      underlying asset was less than the contract price, the investor would
      profit, if it was higher, the investor would lose money.


      It's crucial to keep in mind that leverage trading enables traders to take
      far larger positions than those permitted by the size of their brokerage
      account. Margin investing can result in profits but on the other hand, it
      can also increase losses.


      Consider a trader who has a $60,000 position in crude oil and has a $6,000
      margin account balance. Losses that are far more than the $6,000 initial
      margin amount for the account would happen if the price of oil swings
      against the deal. In such a scenario, the broker would issue a margin call
      and ask the trader to deposit more money in their account to cover up for
      the losses.

      ## Explain buyer and seller in case of a long contract

      Investors and businesses can also enter into long futures contracts to
      protect themselves against unfavourable price changes. A corporation can
      use a long hedge to fix the price at which it will buy a commodity in the
      future when it is required. They are required to carry out these tasks but
      are not given a choice.


      Let's say a jewellery maker thinks the short-term trend for gold prices
      will be rising. The company can agree on a long futures contract with its
      gold supply to buy gold from the provider in three months for $1,300. The
      company that holds a long position in gold futures is required to buy the
      gold from the supplier in three months, regardless of whether the price is
      above or below $1,300. If the prices of gold rise in the upcoming time and
      the maker predicted right then the jewellery maker will profit whereas if
      the prices fall the jewellery maker will be at a loss. When the contract
      ends, the provider is then required to deliver the tangible good.


      Speculators buy futures when they anticipate price increases. They are
      just concerned with profiting from price fluctuations, therefore they
      don't necessarily need the actual commodity. A trader with a long futures
      contract may sell the contract in the market before it expires.


      Hence we can conclude in a long position -

      * Prices rise: The position holder is at a profit

      * Prices fall: The position holder is at a loss

      ## Explain buyer and seller in case of a short contract

      When a trader first sells security with the purpose of later repurchasing
      or covering it at a lower price, they are creating a short, or short
      position. When a trader anticipates that the price of a security will drop
      in the near future, she may elect to short that security.


      Only when the closing price is lower than the entry price is the short
      trade profitable. When the price rises above the price at which one has
      shorted, a loss would result. In a short trade, the stop loss is always
      set higher than the price at which the trade was initiated. In the futures
      market, the short position may be kept open overnight.



      Consider the previous example of a jewellery maker. This time the gold
      provider predicts that the prices of the gold metal will fall in the
      upcoming time period. So this provider can agree upon a short contract for
      three months at $1300. This provider has to sell the gold as per contract
      after three months, regardless of the spot price, at $1300. If the price
      of gold goes below and the provider predicted correctly then he will
      profit otherwise if the prices rise then the provider will be in a loss
      position. When the contract ends, the provider is then required to deliver
      the tangible good. 


      Hence we can conclude in a short position -

      * Prices rise: The position holder is at a loss

      * Prices fall: The position holder is at a profit

      * In futures, the buyer is obligated to honour the contract and in
      options, there is no obligation on the buyer to buy or sell.

      * Futures require higher margin payment compared to options

      * Futures are mostly used by speculators and arbitragers and options are
      used by hedgers.

      * Futures possess unlimited profit and loss whereas in options the profits
      are unlimited and losses are limited.
