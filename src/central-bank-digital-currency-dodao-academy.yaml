      Any form of currency that is accessible with computers or mobile phones.
      This form of money is exclusively available in electronic format only. 


      Electronic currencies are widely used around the globe and are present in
      the financial systems of almost all countries. The prime difference
      between Digital currency and Electronic currency is that digital currency
      in a person’s bank account never takes a physical form.


      For example, A person can go to their ATM can convert the electronic money
      in their bank account into cash whereas digital currency never leaves the
      computer network and can only transfer via a digital medium.


      Digital currencies are of three types mainly: cryptocurrency, stablecoins
      and central bank digital currencies i.e. CBDCs. All cryptocurrencies are
      digital currencies whereas all digital currencies are not
      cryptocurrencies.


      CBDCs are digital tokens that a country's government backs and their value
      is derived from the country’s fiat currency. Many countries are recently
      developing their own CBDCs. Some currently available CBDCs are Central
      Bank of The Bahamas (Sand Dollar), the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank
      (DCash), the Central Bank of Nigeria (e-Naira) and the Bank of Jamaica
      (JamDex).

      A government-issued currency known as "fiat money" is not backed by
      tangible assets like gold or silver. It is regarded as a type of
      acceptable legal money that can be used to transact goods and services.
      Fiat money has always been issued as banknotes and coins. Still, thanks to
      technology, governments and financial institutions can now use a
      credit-based model where balances and transactions are recorded digitally
      to augment physical fiat money.


      The physical form of currency is widely used around the globe, but there
      has been a decline in its usage due to the COVID-19 academic. Thus
      governments are exploring the possibility of incorporating digital
      currencies into their financial systems.


      There are several key differences between CBDC and fiat currency:

      1. CBDC is a digital form of money, while fiat currency is typically
      physical or electronic.

      2. CBDC is issued and backed by the central bank, while fiat currency is
      issued and backed by the government.

      3. CBDC is intended to provide a convenient and secure way to make digital
      transactions, while fiat currency is accepted as legal tender by the
      government that issues it.

      4. CBDC is still in the development and testing phase, while fiat currency
      is widely used and accepted.


      CBDC is a legal tender issued by a central bank in digital form. It is the
      same as fiat currency. It is exchangeable one-to-one with the fiat
      currency.

      The prime objective of CBDCs is to offer financial security, privacy,
      transferability, simplicity, and accessibility to businesses and
      consumers. CBDCs may also minimize the cost of cross-border transactions,
      and lower the expense of maintaining a complicated financial system. 


      There are several potential benefits of central bank digital currency
      (CBDC), including:

      1. **Increased convenience and accessibility** - CBDC can be easily
      accessed and used for digital transactions, providing a more convenient
      and accessible way for individuals and businesses to make payments and
      transfer money.

      2. **Enhanced security and fraud prevention** - CBDC can use advanced
      security features and cryptography to prevent fraud and protect against
      cyber attacks, making it safer than physical cash or traditional
      electronic payments.

      3. **Increased competition and innovation** - CBDC can enable new and
      innovative forms of digital payments and financial services, promoting
      competition and innovation in the financial sector.

      4. **Improved financial inclusion** - CBDC can provide access to financial
      services for individuals and businesses that may not have access to
      traditional banking services, promoting financial inclusion and reducing
      inequality.

      5. **Greater control and stability** - CBDC can provide central banks with
      greater control over the money supply and interest rates, and can help to
      stabilize the economy and promote financial stability in times of crisis
      or volatility.


      When CBDCs are compared to cryptocurrencies, the value of cryptocurrencies
      constantly fluctuates and thus makes them volatile assets. The general
      stability of an economy could be impacted by this volatility, which could
      put many households under significant financial strain. CBDCs would offer
      people and businesses a secure way to exchange digital currency because
      they are backed by the government and regulated by a central bank.

      CBDCs come in two varieties: wholesale and retail. The main users of
      wholesale CBDCs are financial institutions. Retail CBDCs are utilised by
      customers and businesses in a manner similar to that of physical forms of
      money.


      There are two main types of central bank digital currency (CBDC):

      1. **Wholesale CBDC** - this is a digital currency that is issued and used
      by financial institutions and other large market participants, such as
      banks, payment providers, and clearing houses. Wholesale CBDC is intended
      to provide a more efficient and secure way to make large-value payments
      and settle transactions and is not accessible to the general public.

      2. **Retail CBDC** - this is a digital currency that is issued and used by
      the general public and is intended to be used for everyday transactions,
      such as buying goods and services, paying bills, and transferring money.
      Retail CBDC can be accessed by individuals and businesses and is intended
      to provide a more convenient and secure alternative to physical cash and
      electronic money.


      Some central banks are also considering other types of CBDC, such as a
      hybrid model that combines elements of both wholesale and retail CBDC, or
      a two-tier model where the central bank issues the digital currency, but
      it is distributed and used by commercial banks and other intermediaries.
      These different models may offer different benefits and challenges, and
      central banks are still exploring the best approach for their specific
      contexts and needs.

      There are several challenges faced by central bank digital currencies
      (CBDC), including:

      1. **Technological complexity** - developing and implementing CBDC
      involves complex technology, including secure digital wallets, payment
      networks, and cryptographic algorithms. This requires significant
      investment, expertise, and collaboration among different stakeholders, and
      may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks or other technical failures.

      2. **Legal and regulatory uncertainty** - CBDC raises many legal and
      regulatory questions, such as how it will interact with existing laws and
      regulations, who will be responsible for its issuance and oversight, and
      how it will be taxed and accounted for. These issues need to be carefully
      considered and resolved to ensure that CBDC is safe, fair, and effective.

      3. **Monetary and financial stability risks** - CBDC may have implications
      for the broader monetary and financial system, such as how it will affect
      the demand for physical cash, the supply of money, and the transmission of
      monetary policy. Central banks need to carefully assess and manage these
      risks to ensure that CBDC does not destabilize the economy or create
      financial imbalances.

      4. **Privacy and data protection concerns** - CBDC may generate large
      amounts of data and information about individuals' and businesses'
      financial transactions, which could be used for surveillance, fraud, or
      other purposes. Central banks and other authorities need to ensure that
      CBDC is designed and implemented in a way that protects individuals'
      privacy and data rights.

      Many central banks around the globe have CBDC research and projects under
      progress. They are exploring the usability and viability of a CBDC in
      their economy and how it will benefit their country’s financial system. As
      of March 2022, there were nine countries and territories that had launched
      CBDCs.

      * The Bahamas

      * Antigua and Barbuda

      * St. Kitts and Nevis

      * Monserrat

      * Dominica

      * Saint Lucia

      * St. Vincent and the Grenadines

      * Grenada

      * Nigeria


      As of 2021, only a handful of countries have introduced central bank
      digital currencies (CBDCs) for general use. These include


      1. The Bahamas, which launched the world's first CBDC, the Sand Dollar, in
      2020

      2. China, which launched the Digital Yuan in 2020 and is currently
      conducting pilot tests

      3. Sweden is exploring the potential use of the e-krona as a complement to
      cash

      4. The United Arab Emirates, which launched the emCash in 2018

      5. Uruguay introduced the e-peso in 2017


      In February 2022, during the budget speech, the Indian Finance Minister
      announced that it would introduce a digital currency by the end of 2023.
      In August 2021, Jamaica produced its first batch of CBDC. In 2022, the
      Bank of Jamaica is anticipated to introduce its CBDC.


      In order to enhance the domestic payments system, boost productivity, and
      cut expenses, the United States is looking at CBDCs. In March 2022,
      President Biden issued a directive to federal agencies to assess the
      infrastructure required to issue a U.S. CBDC. Bank of England (BOE) and
      Bank of Canada (BOC) are continuing their research for implementing CBDC
      into their financial systems.

      Central bank digital currency (CBDC) and cryptocurrency are both forms of
      digital money, but there are several key differences between them:


      1. **Issuance and backing** - CBDC is issued and backed by the central
      bank of a country, while cryptocurrency is typically issued and backed by
      a decentralized network of computers and users.

      2. **Legal status and acceptance** - CBDC is a legal form of money that is
      accepted as legal tender by the government that issues it, while
      cryptocurrency is not recognized as legal tender by most governments, and
      its acceptance and use may be limited or prohibited in some countries.

      3. **Monetary policy and regulation** - CBDC is subject to monetary policy
      and regulation by the central bank and other authorities, while
      cryptocurrency is typically not subject to monetary policy or law, and its
      supply and value are determined by market forces.


      There are several potential benefits of cryptocurrency over central bank
      digital currency (CBDC), including:


      1. **Decentralization and autonomy** - cryptocurrency is issued and
      managed by decentralized networks of users and miners, without any central
      authority or backing. This provides greater autonomy and independence from
      governments and central banks and allows individuals and businesses to
      make transactions and transfers without intermediaries or restrictions.

      2. **Global reach and accessibility** - cryptocurrency can be used and
      traded anywhere in the world, without the need for borders, currencies, or
      intermediaries. This makes it more accessible and convenient for
      individuals and businesses in different countries and jurisdictions and
      allows for faster and cheaper international transactions.

      3. **Privacy and anonymity** - cryptocurrency can provide greater privacy
      and anonymity for users, allowing them to make transactions and transfers
      without revealing their identity or personal information. This can be
      particularly useful for individuals and businesses that value privacy and
      want to avoid surveillance or censorship.

      4. **Censorship resistance** - cryptocurrency is not subject to censorship
      or control by governments or central banks and can be used for
      transactions and transfers even in countries or situations where
      traditional financial systems are restricted or blocked. This can be
      particularly useful for individuals and businesses that operate in
      repressive or unstable environments.

      Countries having a weaker and vulnerable financial system will not benefit
      from CBDC as firstly it will not be implemented, and secondly, it will
      still be in control of the centralized entity that led to a weaker
      financial model in the first place. 


      In the view of developed nations, it looks like CBDC is better as it
      provides regulation and safety from funds getting lost. On the other hand
      from a global financial perspective crypto is better and no single entity
      controls it. Things like government manipulation of the economy will still
      exist in CBDC as we saw in the case of the pandemic, money was printed and
      then later the interest rates were increased. Many individuals were caught
      by this change in macroeconomics.
