      Bridges are responsible for holding assets on a layer-1 blockchain while
      those same assets are released on another service. This defines who has
      custody of the funds and the conditions that must be met before the assets
      can be unlocked. The withdrawal request destroys coins on the off-chain
      system and updates the bridge contract about the user’s entitlement to
      withdraw their coins back to the Layer 1 blockchain. This allows users to
      move their coins back and forth between the two systems without having to
      worry about losing any of their value.


      Bridges carryout functions similar to the below:

      1. Deposit. A user can deposit funds into the bridge, and then
      corresponding assets are set up on the other system.

      2. Update account balance. The bridge is told about new account balances,
      which can help the withdrawal process.

      3. Withdrawal. A user can withdraw their assets from the bridge according
      to their balance on the other system, and the tokens issued on the other
      system are destroyed.

      4. Censorship resistance. The bridge contract can enforce the eventual
      ordering and execution of transactions to ensure users can always unwind
      their positions and withdraw their funds.


      Trust assumptions for bridge contracts can be classified into three types:

      1. Single organisation. One party has the authority to update the user’s
      balance in the bridge contract. For example, a cryptocurrency exchange.

      2. Multi-organisation. A set of independent parties (K of N) can notify
      the bridge about a user’s new balance. 

      3. Crypto-economic. A dynamic set of parties, appointed by their weight in
      assets, can notify the bridge about a user’s new balance.

      There are three types of workers involved in assessing the security of a
      validating bridge: 

      1. Sequencers - who propose an ordered list of transactions to the bridge
      contract. They offer information about the pending state of the off-chain
      system's database (including account balances, smart contract state,
      etc). 

      2. Executors - who propose the final execution result for a batch of
      transactions by posting state commitments to the bridge contract. 

      3. Challengers/Validators - who validate commitments proposed by the
      executors.

      Following are the security goals considered while designing a bridge


      1. Data availability: How can the bridge be sure that all data for the
      other blockchain network is publicly available, so that users can
      independently recompute the layer-2 database?

      2. State transition integrity: How can the bridge be sure that all state
      transitions for the layer-2 network are well-formed and valid?

      3. Withdrawal integrity: How can the bridge guarantee that all honest
      users' funds can be withdrawn if the layer-2 network is compromised?

      4. Protocol liveness: How can the bridge guarantee that transactions can
      still be executed if the layer-2 protocol is stalled or offline?


      The most popular way of solving the data availability problem is called a
      rollup. In a rollup, all data is posted to the Layer-1 blockchain. This is
      because “computation is expensive but data is cheap on Ethereum”.


      Now, the executor can periodically assert a cryptographic commitment to
      the bridge contract about the off-chain database's new state. This
      commitment is only finalized when the bridge contract is convinced that it
      is valid.

      The validating bridge contract is tasked with protecting the integrity of
      the database and ensuring that proposed state updates are eventually
      applied to the database. This ensures that the database remains live and
      accessible to all users.


      There are two ways in which the commitments can be verified:


      ### Fraud-proof approach(Optimistic) 

      Challengers are responsible for validating commitments posted to the
      bridge contract. There is a challenge time window to provide time for a
      challenger to send indisputable evidence (proof of fraud) about the
      commitment’s validity. If there is no evidence of fraud by the time the
      challenge expires, then the commitment is accepted as valid.


      ### Validity-proof approach (Zero-knowledge)

      The executor must present evidence alongside the commitment to prove that
      all state transitions are valid. There is no challenge period and the
      bridge contract can accept the commitment immediately.


      Zero-knowledge proofs allow the prover to show that a commitment is valid
      without revealing any information about the inputs. This proof can be
      verified quickly and easily, making it a valuable tool for ensuring
      computational integrity. However, the downside of zero-knowledge proofs is
      that they can be computationally intensive for the prover, especially for
      generic computations. Engineers are actively working to improve this
      technology so that it is more efficient and easier to use.
