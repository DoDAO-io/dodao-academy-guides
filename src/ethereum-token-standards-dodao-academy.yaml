      ## Summary


      On token interfaces, a lot of Ethereum development standards are focused.
      These standards aid in maintaining the composability of smart contracts,
      ensuring that, for example, when a new project releases a token, it is
      still compatible with the decentralized exchanges that already exist.



      ## ERC Token Standards


      Ethereum Request for Comments (ERC) is a document that smart contract
      programmers use to create smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain
      platform. These publications specify the requirements that Ethereum-based
      coins must meet. On token interfaces, a lot of Ethereum development
      standards are focused. These standards aid in maintaining the
      composability of smart contracts, ensuring that, for example, when a new
      project releases a token, it is still compatible with the decentralized
      exchanges that already exist.

      ## **ERC-20:** 

      The ERC-20 token standard is a guide for developing fungible tokens on the
      Ethereum network. A token (or a portion of a token) must be fungible in
      order to be equal to and interchangeable with other tokens.


      A coin must support all of the functions and events defined by ERC-20.
      Remember that this standard also controls smart contracts for newly minted
      tokens' activities. The bare minimum requirements for features and data in
      an ERC-20 compatible token are:


      ### Functions used:


      1. `function name() public view returns (string)`

      2. `function symbol() public view returns (string)`

      3. `function decimals() public view returns (uint8)`

      4. `function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)`

      5. `function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256
      balance)`

      6. `function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool
      success)`

      7. `function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value)
      public returns (bool success)`

      8. `function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns
      (bool success)`

      9. `function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view
      returns (uint256 remaining)`


      ### Events are:

      1. `event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256
      _value)`

      2. `event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender,
      uint256 _value)`


      ## **ERC-721:** 

      ERC-721 is a token standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Non-fungible
      tokens are a special type of cryptographic token that cannot be mutually
      interchangeable because of their individual specification. This means that
      1 token cannot be exchanged for another due to its unique specifications.


      An ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token Contract is one that implements the
      functions and events listed below. Once it has been deployed, the contract
      is in charge of managing the tokens that have been produced on Ethereum.


      ### Functions used:


      1. `function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256);`

      2. `function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address);`

      3. `function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256
      _tokenId, bytes data) external payable;`

      4. `function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256
      _tokenId) external payable;`

      5. `function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId)
      external payable;`

      6. `function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external
      payable;`

      7. `function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved)
      external;`

      8. `function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns
      (address);`

      9. `function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external
      view returns (bool);`


      ### Events are:




      1. `event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256
      indexed _tokenId);`

      2. `event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _approved,
      uint256 indexed _tokenId);`

      3. `event ApprovalForAll(address indexed _owner, address indexed
      _operator, bool _approved);`

      ## **ERC-777:** 

      ERC-777 is an improved version of the ERC-20 token standard. It addresses
      the limitations of ERC-20 by making it more efficient for smart contracts
      to send and receive tokens. This is done through a mechanism known as
      ‘Hooks’. Hooks is a function that combines two messages - sending tokens
      and notifying a contract - into one. In addition, the ERC-777 also
      introduces the ability to reject transactions from a blacklisted address.

       A smart contract's code describes a function called hooks. When tokens are sent or received through the contract, hooks are called. This enables a smart contract to respond to tokens coming into or going out of it.

      ## **ERC-1155:** 

      A common interface for token management contracts that handle various
      token kinds. Any mix of fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens, or other
      configurations may be used in a single deployed contract (e.g.
      semi-fungible tokens).


      The goal is to develop a smart contract interface that can represent and
      manage any number of fungible and non-fungible token kinds. The concept is
      straightforward. The ERC-1155 coin can thus do the same tasks as an ERC-20
      and ERC-721 token, and even both simultaneously. The best part is that the
      ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards have improved functionality, efficiency, and
      correction of glaring implementation flaws.


      ## **ERC-4626:** 

      The ERC-4626 standard was created to optimize and unify the technical
      parameters of yield-bearing vaults. It provides a standard API for
      tokenized yield-bearing vaults that represent shares of a single
      underlying ERC-20 token. The optional extension for tokenized vaults
      utilizing ERC-20 offers basic functionality for depositing, withdrawing
      tokens, and reading balances.


      Lending markets, aggregators, and intrinsically interest-bearing tokens
      help users find the best yield on their crypto tokens by executing
      different strategies. However, these strategies are often done with slight
      variations that can lead to errors or waste of development resources.


      ERC-4626 in yield-bearing vaults will lower the integration effort and
      unlock access to yield in various applications with little specialized
      effort from developers. This will create more consistent and robust
      implementation patterns.

      ## Other Standards for Fungible Tokens


      * **ERC-1404:** The ERC-1404 consensus allows token creators greater
      control over token circulation and user visibility. The token differs from
      the typical ERC-20 standard frequently applied to altcoins by having the
      ability to identify holders of the token and freeze supply. 

      * **ERC-223:** Token contracts and contracts working with specific tokens
      can implement standard functions described in ERC-223 to prevent
      unintentional token sends to contracts and make token transactions behave
      like ether transactions.

      * **ERC-667:** The ERC-677 standard aims to provide additional
      functionality without overriding the existing ERC-20 standard. This
      standard adds a new function, transferAndCall(), which is unlike the
      ERC-223 standard, which overrides the existing transfer() function.

      * **ERC-1203:** The Standard interface for a token contract with multiple
      token classes is also ERC-20 compatible, which makes it an ideal solution
      for those looking to use a variety of tokens within their application or
      system.

      ## Other Standards for Non-Fungible Tokens

      * **EIP-5114**: Soulbound Badge was first proposed in 2019 by the Ethereum
        developer Eric Conner, and is currently in the process of being reviewed
        and discussed by the Ethereum community. Some of the key features of
        EIP-5114: Soulbound Badge include:
        
          1. Unique digital assets: EIP-5114: Soulbound Badge allows for the
          creation of unique digital assets that cannot be replicated or divided,
          providing a strong foundation for applications such as collectibles and
          gaming assets.
          
          2. Secure ownership: EIP-5114: Soulbound Badge includes built-in
          mechanisms to ensure that the ownership of soulbound badges is secure and
          cannot be transferred or stolen.
          
          3. Flexible token behavior: EIP-5114: Soulbound Badge allows for the
          customization of the behavior of soulbound badges, including rules for how
          they can be transferred and other aspects of their functionality.
          Overall, EIP-5114: Soulbound Badge is seen as a valuable addition to the
          Ethereum ecosystem, providing a strong foundation for applications that
          require unique, non-fungible digital assets. If adopted, it could enable
          the creation of a wide range of new applications and use cases on the
          Ethereum blockchain.

      * **ERC-809:** The standard for renting out your NFTs, is by creating an
      API to allow any “rival” NFT to be rented. An NFT is considered rival if
      being in possession of the NFT simultaneously prevents consumption/access
      to other individuals. ERC-864

      * **ERC-1190:** The ERC-1190 token will allow the creators of unique
      digital objects, such as a work of art or an object in a game, to benefit
      from the use of those objects over time. This means that even if the
      object is not used for a long period of time, the creator will still
      receive compensation for its use.

      * **ERC-1238:** ERC-1238 is the standard for Non-transferable tokens that
      represent "badges". A badge is a token that, once given, cannot be
      changed. Over time, badges can accrue and be put at risk. In a nutshell,
      badges are declarations about a public key; they might be qualitative or
      quantitative (e.g., reputation, experience) (badges, titles).

      * **ERC-994:** Delegated Non-Fungible Tokens, or DNFTs, are a proposed
      extension of the ERC721 standard that aims to provide a way to register
      land and physical property on the Ethereum blockchain. NFTs are arranged
      in a federated, tree-like format (similar to DNS), allowing NFTs to
      delegate and sub-contract other NFTs within a certain geographic area.

      * **ERC-998:** The standard extension for a non-fungible token is to own
      other non-fungible ERC-721 or standard fungible ERC-20 tokens. This means
      that the entire hierarchy of items is transferred when the token
      composition is transferred.

      ## Standards for Transferring tokens

      * **ERC-965: **The aim of this proposal is to allow for pre-signed
      messages that would enable third parties to execute a token transfer
      without the original sender needing to do an on-chain transaction. The
      sender would need to sign a message and the third party would call
      sendByCheque() with the signature. This would save the sender time and
      effort in having to do an on-chain transaction.

      * **ERC-865: **This proposal outlines a standard function that a token
      contract can implement to allow a user to delegate the transfer of tokens
      to a third party. The third party would be responsible for paying the gas
      fees associated with the transfer, and would also take a small fee in
      tokens as compensation.

      * **ERC-995:** The ERC223 standard provides an augmented token transfer
      functionality that goes beyond the legacy ERC20 functionality. It allows
      you to execute calls on transfers and approvals both before and after
      tokens are transferred, regardless of whether the receiving address is a
      contract or not. 


      ## Standards for multiple token

      * **ERC-1178:** The ERC1178 contract allows for multiple types of
      collectibles to be defined, which means that any number of a given type of
      collectible can be transferred at once. This is particularly useful for
      less expensive collectibles that might not have much value individually
      but could be quite valuable when bought in bulk.


      ## Some other Standards 

      * **ERC-981: **The purpose of this proposal is to introduce a new Ethereum
      Interface that would allow asset owners to issue tokens in a marketplace.
      This would be done by dividing the asset into divisible units, which in
      turn would increase the fungibility of that asset. Doing this would create
      more opportunities for those who own a finite quantity of an asset to
      trade it.
