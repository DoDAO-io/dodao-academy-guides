      Ethereum is a decentralized platform for building and running
      decentralized applications (dApps), and uses various token standards to
      enable different types of tokens and assets to be created and traded on
      the platform. The main token standards in Ethereum are:


      1. **ERC-20** - is the most widely used and well-known token standard in
      Ethereum, and allows for the creation of tokens that are interchangeable
      and can be easily transferred and traded on the Ethereum blockchain.
      ERC-20 tokens are used for a wide range of purposes, including
      fundraising, payments, rewards, and gaming.


      2. **ERC-721** - is a non-fungible token (NFT) standard, which allows for
      the creation of unique and indivisible tokens that represent collectibles,
      art, assets, or other non-fungible items. ERC-721 tokens are often used
      for digital collectibles, art, and gaming, and can be traded and exchanged
      on the Ethereum blockchain.


      3. **ERC-1155** - is a hybrid token standard, which allows for the
      creation of both fungible and non-fungible tokens in a single smart
      contract. This standard allows for greater flexibility and efficiency in
      managing different types of tokens and assets, and can be used for a wide
      range of applications

      ERC777 is a proposed Ethereum token standard that is designed to improve
      upon the existing ERC20 standard. ERC777 adds several new features to
      ERC20, including the ability to support multiple recipients in a single
      transaction, the ability to send tokens to smart contracts, and the
      ability to customize the behavior of tokens. These enhancements are
      intended to make ERC777 more flexible and useful for a wide range of
      applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi) and other
      blockchain-based projects.


      ERC777 was first proposed in 2018 by developers Amir Eslampanah and Jordi
      Baylina. It is currently in the process of being finalized and adopted by
      the Ethereum community, with several projects already using the standard.
      Some of the key benefits of ERC777 compared to ERC20 include:


      1. Support for multiple recipients: ERC777 allows for tokens to be sent to
      multiple recipients in a single transaction, which can reduce transaction
      fees and improve efficiency.

      2. Support for smart contract interactions: ERC777 allows tokens to be
      sent to smart contracts, which can enable a wide range of DeFi and other
      applications.

      3. Customizable token behavior: ERC777 allows token issuers to customize
      the behavior of their tokens, including setting rules for how they can be
      transferred and other aspects of their functionality.

      4. Improved security: ERC777 includes several security enhancements over
      ERC20, including the ability to detect and prevent common attacks such as
      the reentrancy attack.


      Overall, ERC777 is seen as a significant improvement over ERC20, and is
      expected to become a widely used token standard in the Ethereum ecosystem.
