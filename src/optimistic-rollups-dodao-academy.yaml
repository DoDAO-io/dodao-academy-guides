      ## Bridges/Rollups


      Bridges are responsible for holding assets on a layer-1 blockchain while
      those same assets are released on another service. This defines who has
      custody of the funds and the conditions that must be met before the assets
      can be unlocked. The withdrawal request destroys coins on the off-chain
      system and updates the bridge contract about the user’s entitlement to
      withdraw their coins back to the Layer 1 blockchain. This allows users to
      move their coins back and forth between the two systems without having to
      worry about losing any of their value.


      Bridges carryout functions similar to the below:

      1. Deposit. A user can deposit funds into the bridge, and then
      corresponding assets are set up on the other system.

      2. Update account balance. The bridge is told about new account balances,
      which can help the withdrawal process.

      3. Withdrawal. A user can withdraw their assets from the bridge according
      to their balance on the other system, and the tokens issued on the other
      system are destroyed.

      4. Censorship resistance. The bridge contract can enforce the eventual
      ordering and execution of transactions to ensure users can always unwind
      their positions and withdraw their funds.

      The validating bridge contract is tasked with protecting the integrity of
      the database and ensuring that proposed state updates are eventually
      applied to the database. This ensures that the database remains live and
      accessible to all users.


      There are two ways in which the commitments can be verified:


      ### Fraud-proof approach(Optimistic) 

      Challengers are responsible for validating commitments posted to the
      bridge contract. There is a challenge time window to provide time for a
      challenger to send indisputable evidence (proof of fraud) about the
      commitment’s validity. If there is no evidence of fraud by the time the
      challenge expires, then the commitment is accepted as valid.


      ### Validity-proof approach (Zero-knowledge). The executor must present
      evidence alongside the commitment to prove that all state transitions are
      valid. There is no challenge period and the bridge contract can accept the
      commitment immediately.


      Zero-knowledge proofs allow the prover to show that a commitment is valid
      without revealing any information about the inputs. This proof can be
      verified quickly and easily, making it a valuable tool for ensuring
      computational integrity. However, the downside of zero-knowledge proofs is
      that they can be computationally intensive for the prover, especially for
      generic computations. Engineers are actively working to improve this
      technology so that it is more efficient and easier to use.

      There are currently two approaches for pinpointing a disputed state
      transition in Optimistic Rollups:


      1. **One-round fraud proof** -  means that the challenger has a list of
      intermediary state transitions for the commitment being asserted, which
      can be used to pinpoint the disputed state transition. The challenger then
      submits the disputed intermediary state transitions along with a list of
      inclusion proofs about the state transition's pre-state, the state
      transition itself, and the executor's asserted post-state after it is
      executed. This allows for quick and easy fraud detection in commitments. 
       
      In Optimism, all state commitments are sent to the bridge contract,
      allowing a challenger to identify which state transition should be
      executed by the bridge contract. No cooperation with the executor is
      necessary, and a valid commitment cannot be evaluated as invalid by a
      fraud proof. If a commitment is proven to be invalid, it can be discarded,
      along with slashing the executor who proposed it. However, for V2 they’re
      moving towards using interactive proofs. \


      2. **Multi-round fraud proof** - is a method used to make it harder for
      fraud to happen. In this system, the list of intermediary state
      transitions for an asserted commitment is not sent to the bridge contract.
      This makes it more difficult to pinpoint an individual state transition in
      a single-round. Instead, the challenger and executor must agree upon the
      total number of instructions executed within the commitment. They will
      then perform a binary search until they pinpoint the disputed
      instruction. 
       
      Arbitrum's multi-round fraud proof system is a binary search between two
      parties to find the first opcode of a whole block that they disagree on.
      Once found, only this particular opcode is executed on-chain.
